# How to Contribute:
I welcome contributions from both developers and designers!

- Developers: You can contribute by adding your own project collections or showcasing implementations based on the provided Figma designs.
- Designers: If you have your own Figma designs and want to collaborate, feel free to share your work! Your designs can be added to the collection, and developers will help bring them to life with code.
